    <h3>
        When it affects infrastructures or essential services such as electricity networks, telecommunications,
        transport systems, banking services or major government sites, a cyber attack causes disruptions that can
        greatly jeopardize services for the public, and have very serious economic consequences.

        A cyber attack is a malicious act by persons, groups or organizations against a computer system that is intended
        to destroy or damage it, fool it or take control of it in order to carry out illegitimate operations or steal
        data. A cyber attack can be against a computer, a server, peripherals  or mobile
        communication devices . Such an act is usually committed through a local network
        or an Internet connection.
